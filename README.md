# Welcome to my Java card game!
This is my first game working with visuals in Java.
This is a game of comparing cards and accumulating score.

1. Extract image folder from images.zip
2. Compile Java files in src folder
3. Run CardGame.java to launch the game!

To play, drag two cards from either deck into two slots.
The cards are then compared according to the rules laid out in the menu...
